
1. Get unitx and unity
2. Get movex and movey
3. Get distx

# unitx + (movex-unitx) = movex

if (unitx > movex) { distx is negative }
distx = movex - unitx

# You can get which one is bigger by:
if distx > 128 and disty > 128 subtract 128 from both

# Then whichever which one is still around is the larger one
if unitx is still around we are looking at a negative, otherwise positive, transfer to distx

4. Transfer unitx, movex, and unity, movey back to their rightful places
5. Get disty with a similar process
6. If the sum of the two of them is too big subtract from one of movex or movey, then move the unit back after that


Furthermore, I think I should consider utilizing the mission objectives somewhat.

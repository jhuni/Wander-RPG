One of the two will still be around in the end, and that will determine which one is bigger.

my ($isActive) = vars(1);
my ($heroX, $lastX, $diffx, $commonX) = vars(255, 255, 255, 255);
heroX, heroY have just been found
lastX, lastY are still undef, do something special here
get commonality between lastX and heroX
set diffx to either lastx or herox, whichever is larger 
If diffx == 0, still = true
If lastx was the one larger, diffx = 0
diffx += commanality
heroX, lastX = commanlity;

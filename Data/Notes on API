Always and Never are unnecessary crap
Switch is part of the boolean API
Accumulate, Deaths, Score, and Timer are all rw unsigned ints

Ro unsigned ints:
Elapsed Time - no args
Opponents - player as arg
Kills and Command - player and a unit are args
Bring - location, player, unit

Highest or Lowest:
Score, Kills, and Resource, Units, and Units at Location

# Unit Class
Unit, Player, Location combination...
RemoveUnit, KillUnit, CreateUnit, GiveUnits

Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") += 5; (createUnit)
Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -= 5; (removeUnit)
Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -> kill(5);
Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -> give("Player 1", 5);
Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -> moveTo("Selection Area", 5);
Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -> order("Move To", "Selection Area");

Unit("Player 1", "Terran Marine", "Anywhere") -> set({
	invincibility: true,
	hp: 50,
	sp: 5,
	ep: 10,
	res: 1000,
	hangar: 6,
	doodad: 'enable'
}, 5);

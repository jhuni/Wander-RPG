***Crucially important
Make it so that you don't build houses more then once.
	- I don't know why this happens
	
Make it so that you can leave houses.
	- When the leave event is called,
	- Remove the current house
	- Move the marine back to the world


***Not necessarily that important:
Place the marine on the opposite end of map, even if it isn't accurate for now.

Make it so that you can have junkyard dog in towns
	- Make a switch called unitCreated and use the psi emmiter trick for each player.

Deal with the issue of vision after moving to a new town.
